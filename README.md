## ESI for "Bayesian determination of the effect of a deep eutectic solvent on the structure of lipid monolayers"

[Andrew R. McCluskey](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3381-5911)

This is the electronic supplementary information (ESI) associated with the publication "Bayesian determination of the effect of a deep eutectic solvent on the structure of lipid monolayers" (McCluskey, Sanchez-Fernandez, Edler, Parker, Jackson, Campbell, Arnold) [1].

### Data

The experimental data can be obtained from the University of Bath Research Data Achieve.

DOI: [some doi]()

### Analysis

This ESI aims to provide a fully reproducible workflow to analysis of the data presented within the paper.

Requirements:

- anaconda or miniconda python
- make

The supplied Makefile, will reproduce all of the analysis, plot the figures, and build a preprint version of the paper when run. Be aware that the analyses within this work are non-trivial and take many hours to run so **use caution** before re-running all the analysis.

If you **still** want to re-run all of the analysis, the following commands can be used:

```
conda create --name paper_env python

source activate paper_env

wget **BATH DATA TO COME**

pip install -r config/requirements.txt

make clean #this will remove all of the output from previous runs

make
```

### Figures

PDF versions of the figures, as generated by the analyses can be found in the `reports/figures` directory.
