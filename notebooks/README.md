## /notebooks

This contains the Jupyter notebook files, and converted Python scripts, used for the analysis of the X-ray and Neutron reflectometry data.

When the `Makefile` in the top level directory is run `nbconvert` generates the `.py` files from the existing `.ipynb` notebooks. These Python scripts are then run for each lipid for XRR and NR.
